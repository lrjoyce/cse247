10) Common sense states going down up from right to left, when inverted, will go down up from left to right 

11) Starting with the base case, the first node in postorder listing is the deepest node on the leftmost path which equals the last in a right to left preorder.
In postorder, the next node listed will be its parent and in preorder the node before will be the parent, creating a reverse listing of that path.
This can be applied to every path, and since one ordering is left to right, the paths will be read in reverse order, maintaining the reverse property.
